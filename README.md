## Run Analysis scripts

# run_analysis.R
This R-script performs a data analysis on the original data found in "UCI HAR Dataset", findable in http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The analysis concerns:
- merging training and test data
- selecting mean and standard deviation measurements
- adding variable names
- writing a tidy dataset, including the averages of the variables for each subject and variable, arranged in order

# CodeBook.md
This textfile explains the variables included in the tidy dataset, and how these relate to the original data

# tidyData.txt
Tabular datafile containing the tidy dataset, resulting from the R-script
